# Threads Clone.

Threads Clone is an react native app that faithfully replicates the home page of the Threads app, which is an online social media and social networking service operated by Meta Platforms. It has been meticulously crafted using the powerful combination of React native, expo router, expo image and faker-js to provide a true-to-life representation of the Threads Home page.
